# **SHARK-ATTACKS project.**

---
### Introduction.
This project involves cleaning and transforming a dataset of shark attacks. The dataset was originally in a CSV file format called `attacks.csv` and was loaded into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.

---
### Dataset Exploration.
The initial step in this project was to explore the dataset to gain an understanding of the data and its structure. This involved examining the columns of the dataset, identifying missing or incomplete data, and analyzing the distribution of values within each column. All of this in `data_exploration.ipynb`

The dataset contains information about shark attacks, including the date of the attack, the type of activity the victim was engaged in at the time of the attack, and the location of the attack. It also includes additional information such as the gender and age of the victim, the type of shark involved, and the severity of the attack.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation.
Once the dataset was explored, the next step was to clean and transform the data. This involved removing or imputing missing data, converting columns to the appropriate data types, and renaming columns to be more descriptive. All included in `data_cleaning.ipynb`.

---
### Conclusion.
The Shark-Attacks project demonstrates how to clean and transform a real-world dataset using Pandas in Python. By exploring the dataset and identifying areas that need cleaning and transformation, it is possible to turn messy data into useful insights.
